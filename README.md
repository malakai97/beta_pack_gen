## Description

A small script to generated Beta booster packs for
Magic: the Gathering.  The rarities were established by
examining the actual print sheets.  

This is the best beta pack generator I know of.

## Usage

You'll need ruby installed.  If you have it, simply do:

```
ruby gen.rb <packs_per_pool> <number_of_pools>
```

For example:
```ruby gen.rb 9 8```
